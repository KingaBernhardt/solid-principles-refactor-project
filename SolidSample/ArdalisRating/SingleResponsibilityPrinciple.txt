Possible refactoring to the RatingEngine class:
Logging -> create a ConsoleLogger class with method Log(string message) which does the Console.Writeline(message).
The add a property to the class  of this type.

Persistence: Create a new FilePolicySource and JsonPolicySerializer class which has a method GetPolicyFromSource, GetPolizyFromJsonString which returns File.ReadAllText("policy.json").
Add a property of this type.
